Release v2.0.6.0
----
- Integration with the external .NET Tools CS-Script and Syntaxer is now the only integration option.
  This change is to ensure the plugin is always integrated with the latest internally compatible CS-Script tools.
- You can always integrate the plugin with the latest CS-Script tools by running the `Detect and Integrate` command from plugin's Config Dialog.
- If you do not have CS-Script tools installed you can single-click deploy them form the 'Update' tab of the Confog dialog.
- The .NET Tools manager is made the default deployment option for CS-Script and Syntaxer
- Embedded CS-Script engine is no longer distributed with the plugin.
